# auto-gallery
 
A work in progress application that plans to generate a gallery page using images in a specified folder

Building this for my website, hoping to extend it to a simple tool that can be used by anyone.

## To-Do

- [x] Populate webpage with images 
- [ ] Automatically arrange images to fill page
- [ ] Generate metadata file for every image containing title, date taken, camera info, etc
- [ ] Display data through website, hover/tap
- [ ] Navbar / Search / Orginize photos
- [ ] Desktop app?

# auto-gallery
 
A work in progress desktop app that plans to generate a gallery webpage using images from a local folder or cloud-based storage platform.

Building this for my website, hoping to extend it to a simple tool that can be used by anyone.

## Loose To-Do

### Desktop app (built with electron.js)
- [ ] Create Gallery
- [ ] Upload images to gallery

   - [ ] Mini map feature that shows location?

- [ ] Metadata file (JSON?)
- [ ] JS code to generate webpage procedurally, with descriptions availible on interaction
- [ ] ??? Profit
